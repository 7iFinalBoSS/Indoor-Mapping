# Indoor-Mapping
# TensorFlow Lite Object Detection






TensorFlow Lite is an optimized framework for deploying lightweight deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices. TensorFlow Lite models have faster inference time and require less processing power than regular TensorFlow models, so they can be used to obtain faster performance in realtime applications. 


##  Train TensorFlow Lite Models
### Using Google Colab (recommended)

The easiest way to train, convert, and export a TensorFlow Lite model is using Google Colab. Colab provides you with a free GPU-enabled virtual machine on Google's servers that comes pre-installed with the libraries and packages needed for training.
